# codeChallenges
Repository of different code challenges.

## Goals
Each repository will hopefully contain 3 (or more) folders for each language solution. This could change to be one directory representating the challenge with just the solutions there.

## Layout
Each challenge will be broken out by the challenge itself and the parent site/location.

## Code
The code is simply what has been submitted to the challenge site. The submissions do not change the score, but allow me to play with each language.
