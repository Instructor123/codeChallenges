# codeChallenges
Repository of different code challenges.

## Goals
Each repository will hopefully contain 3 (or more) folders for each language solution. This could change to be one directory representating the challenge with just the solutions there.

## Layout
Each challenge will be broken out by the challenge itself and the parent site/location.

## Code
The code is simply what has been submitted to the challenge site. The submissions do not change the score, but allow me to play with each language.

This took far longer than it should have due to missing the initial for loop limiter, then over complicating the body. Reviewing my history I was 90% of the way there, however since I did not stop my for loop early enough I understood that to be a problem in the body as opposed to the loop itself. Later I came back and updated the loop, but was too far down the rabbit hole to undo my changes in the body.
